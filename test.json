His bluff and bluster are powerless as thousands of Americans die and the blame falls, in part, on his failure to heed the warnings and execute a robust\\xc2\\xa0national response. This occurred even though a pandemic\\xc2\\xa0playbook\\xc2\\xa0had been left behind by the Obama administration. Early in the crisis,\\xc2\\xa0Trump said\\xc2\\xa0\"We have it totally under control. It\\'s one person coming from China. It\\'s going to be just fine.\" Weeks were wasted and now the price of this fiasco will likely be a loss of life far greater than 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina.\\nMichael D\\'Antonio\\nOn one level, Trump\\'s failure can be traced to his original lie: the false image he sold to the American people in order to hide his shortcomings. Never a competent manager of complex organizations -- witness his many\\xc2\\xa0bankruptcies\\xc2\\xa0-- Trump rose to fame pitching the illusion that he was a great businessman. As he sought the presidency he used counterattacks, lies, and skillful denials to avoid answering for his record and gain the White House.\\nAs someone who has studied Trump for years, I thought it was inevitable that he would eventually reach a moment of reckoning as president. I couldn\\'t have imagined that it would come with the catastrophic consequences now facing the nation as Covid-19 overwhelms health care systems and brings the economy to a standstill. Trump\\'s profound personal shortcomings -- deficiencies of his heart and mind -- helped bring us to this moment.\\nThe first of Trump\\'s weaknesses? His lack of emotional intelligence and empathy, which causes him to struggle to relate to human suffering. The developer who made tenants\\xc2\\xa0miserable\\xc2\\xa0so they would\\xc2\\xa0move out\\xc2\\xa0allowing him to build luxury condos, became the president who\\xc2\\xa0downplayed\\xc2\\xa0hurricane deaths in\\xc2\\xa0Puerto Rico, and now barely speaks of those stricken and killed by the coronavirus. Instead, he obsesses over TV ratings and the economy as if his image in the media and the ups and downs of Wall Street indices matter more than life itself.\\nThe second of Trump\\'s deficiencies is a habit of mind that discounts expertise and elevates\\xc2\\xa0convenient opinions\\xc2\\xa0supported by cherry-picked sources of misinformation. Businessman Trump exhibited this willful ignorance when, for example, he said the scientific connection between\\xc2\\xa0asbestos exposure\\xc2\\xa0and disease was a matter of a conspiracy carried out by mobsters. Candidate Trump discounted the expertise of experts leading the war on terror. And President Trump has claimed to have\\xc2\\xa0extensive knowledge\\xc2\\xa0on a vast array of topics from forest management to drones.\\nTrump administration sent protective medical gear to China while he minimized the virus threat to US\\nTrump\\'s arrogance as a businessman and a candidate was obnoxious but not terribly dangerous. In a president, it puts America\\'s fate into the hands of a man who was incapable of learning even from his own aides. Faced with an enemy that is literally killing people he stayed true to form as he pushed an\\xc2\\xa0unproven\\xc2\\xa0coronavirus treatment\\xc2\\xa0that\\'s still under scientific review. \"What do we have to lose?\" Trump asked musing that people could just get prescriptions for the drug. But without clear messaging there\\'s plenty to lose. A\\xc2\\xa0man died and his wife was under critical care after the two tried to self-medicate for the novel coronavirus\\xc2\\xa0with chloroquine phosphate -- an additive used to clean fish tanks. The wife said she heard people on TV talking about the drug chloroquine.\\nIgnorant as he can seem, the President seems to sense that this moment will establish his reputation in perpetuity. He said as much last week when he\\xc2\\xa0observed that, \"the history books will never forget\" America\\'s response to the coronavirus. What he did not mention, however, is that his response to the pandemic will be examined in minute detail -- it is this prospect, the prospect of accountability, that looms over him now.\\nUntil this crisis, Trump had avoided accountability with remarkable consistency. Born into astounding wealth, he\\xc2\\xa0avoided accountability\\xc2\\xa0by persuading creditors that he was too big to fail even after he ran businesses into the ground. In politics, he deflected accountability by blaming others, especially the press and Democrats, for problems that occurred on his watch. Recently, when asked about the dreadful federal failures on\\xc2\\xa0coronavirus testing, he said, bluntly, \"I don\\'t take responsibility at all.\"\\nHistorians will eventually write books detailing what journalists already know about the Trump administration\\'s dereliction of duty when the pandemic hit.\\xc2\\xa0America\\'s Covid-19 death toll\\xc2\\xa0now passes 2,800 and the caseload exceeds 157,200 cases, But through much of the time that the number of cases was growing, the White House offered no coherent national response to the crisis. There have been sparse moments when Trump has\\xc2\\xa0sounded like a leader\\xc2\\xa0capable of handling this crisis -- like during his briefing on Sunday, in which he announced that he was extending social distancing guidelines through the end of April. But these moments don\\'t last long before Trump back to pitting states against each other and attacking journalists who ask legitimate questions about his response to the pandemic.\\nTrump finally leveled with the American people\\nNo federal agency is rallying health care workers to move to hot spots where they are needed. Instead of assertively coordinating and distributing vital equipment, the administration is letting states, hospitals, and federal agencies\\xc2\\xa0compete\\xc2\\xa0against each other. Trump even went so far as to accuse medical workers of hoarding supplies.\\nRecently Trump introduced a bit of personal petulance to this dynamic, suggesting that governors who\\xc2\\xa0aren\\'t sufficiently deferential\\xc2\\xa0should be ignored by the White House. (He leavened this remark by noting that Vice President Mike Pence is not following his lead.) Michigan Gov.\\xc2\\xa0Gretchen Whitmer,\\xc2\\xa0whom Trump singled out for criticism, reported that orders made for equipment had been canceled as suppliers favored the feds over her state.\\nThe president\\'s complaints about not being appreciated remind us that he takes everything personally and that his personal qualities of heartlessness and intellectual dishonesty will hobble his response to our suffering. Acutely attuned to his own feelings, he\\'s so numb to the pain of others that he avoids talking about it. If he has shed a tear or allowed his voice to tremble with grief during this pandemic I have not observed him do it. Likewise, he remains devoted to discounting reliable scientific information that shows things getting worse in favor of happy talk. With health care workers reusing disposable masks and using trash bags as protective gowns, Trump considered the federal effort to supply hospitals and\\xc2\\xa0announced, \"It\\'s hard not to be happy with the job we\\'re doing.\"\\nMeanwhile, governors across the country are demonstrating what\\xc2\\xa0competence, empathy, and intelligence\\xc2\\xa0look like.\\xc2\\xa0New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for one, has used his televised briefings to offer accurate information and authentic human concern. He doesn\\'t ignore the pain and grief but rather acknowledges it and shares his own. Everything about Cuomo\\'s briefings, right down to the concise slides flashed to accompany his words, reeks of competence. Where Trump repeats\\xc2\\xa0buzzwords\\xc2\\xa0and tries to sell himself as all-powerful, Cuomo demonstrates that he understands the pandemic and can communicate the facts.\\nGet our free weekly newsletter\\n\\nSign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new\\xc2\\xa0newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on\\xc2\\xa0Twitter\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Facebook\\n\\nAt the epicenter of the nation\\'s and the world\\'s pandemic, Cuomo has been reminding us that the worst of the crisis is just beginning. The same is true for history\\'s assessment of President Trump. The coronavirus is immune to his manipulation and spin. It is the defining challenge of his presidency and of his life. Compared with other presidential crises, like the 9/11 attacks or Hurricane Katrina, it has occurred slowly, with ample warning, giving the president many opportunities to act and, we see now, fail.\\nThe accounting will continue. And like the pandemic, it will be devastating.', 'nbrReplies': 0, 'likes': 0, 'publishedAt': u'2020-03-31T04:03:21.000Z', 'author': u'Joseph jo'}), (u'KNOYRKzeoTg', u'President Trump and Coronavirus Task Force update on pandemic  | USA TODAY', {'text': 'I cant even call my doctor line is busy just want to be tested', 'nbrReplies': 1, 'likes': 1, 'publishedAt': u'2020-03-31T03:50:16.000Z', 'author': u'Carrie R,'}), (u'KNOYRKzeoTg', u'President Trump and Coronavirus Task Force update on pandemic  | USA TODAY', {'text': 'Dam', 'nbrReplies': 0, 'likes': 0, 'publishedAt': u'2020-03-31T03:49:32.000Z', 'author': u'Carrie R,'}), (u'KNOYRKzeoTg', u'President Trump and Coronavirus Task Force update on pandemic  | USA TODAY', {'text': 'COVID19 IS OPENING, THE NEXT LEVEL IS DOOM', 'nbrReplies': 0, 'likes': 1, 'publishedAt': u'2020-03-31T03:25:27.000Z', 'author': u'chilex Ba'}), (u'KNOYRKzeoTg', u'President Trump and Coronavirus Task Force update on pandemic  | USA TODAY', {'text': 'I do not know what happens to the governors of the USA \\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xba\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb8  who do not put in place DRASTIC MEASURES!! for the citizens this avoiding the pandemic!', 'nbrReplies': 0, 'likes': 0, 'publishedAt': u'2020-03-31T03:06:05.000Z', 'author': u'Lucil saumonte'}), (u'KNOYRKzeoTg', u'President Trump and Coronavirus Task Force update on pandemic  | USA TODAY', {'text': \"Orlando's response to Coronavirus,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa0The usual busy streets of downtown Orlando are empty on this day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/ix5fK25Ddvg\", 'nbrReplies': 0, 'likes': 0, 'publishedAt': u'2020-03-31T02:35:59.000Z', 'author': u'Noel Blair'}), (u'KNOYRKzeoTg', u'President Trump and Coronavirus Task Force update on pandemic  | USA TODAY', {'text': 'Everyone is on their own seems like,   Even though rules have been made its too many chiefs & no Indians... be safe everyone.

Take note: 2 CORINTHIANS 8:13-15  \" \\'For I do not want to make it easy for others, but difficult for you; 14  but that by means of an equalizing, your surplus at the present time might offset their need, so that their surplus might also offset your deficiency, that there may be an equalizing. 15  Just as it is written: \\'The person with much did not have too much, and the person with little did not have too little.\\' \"  Certainly this pandemic tests your faith and humanity to the hilt.

It's all there.\\n\\nWorth pondering.. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust Think about this... \\n\\nPakistan & North Korea has low virus because they are\\n\\n\\nstaunch ally of China. On the other hand South Korea / United Kingdom / Italy /\\nSpain and rest of Asia are severely hit. And how come Wuhan is suddenly free\\nfrom the deadly virus?\\n\\n\\nChina will say that their drastic initial measures they took\\n\\n\\nwas very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas.\\nI am sure they are using the Antidote of the virus. \\n\\n\\nBut why Beijing was not hit?\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhy only Wuhan? Kind of interesting to ponder upon.. right? Well ..Wuhan\\nis open for business now. America and the rest of the countries are devastated\\nfinancially. Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China.\\xc2\\xa0 China knows it CANNOT defeat America\\nmilitarily as USA is at present.\\n\\n\\nAmerica is THE MOST POWERFUL country in the world as of now.\\n\\n\\nSo use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyze the nation and its\\nDefense capabilities. I'm sure \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNancy Pelosi\\xe2\\x80\\x9d got a part in this. . to topple\\nTrump. Lately President Trump was always telling of how GREAT American economy\\nwas improving in all fronts. The only way to destroy his vision of making\\nAMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an economic havoc. Nancy Pelosi was unable to\\nbring down Trump thru impeachment, so it could also be a possibility that she worked\\nalong with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus. Wuhan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s epidemic was a\\nshowcase. At the peak of the virus epidemic, China's President Xi Jinping just\\nwore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those affected areas.\\xc2\\xa0 As President he should be covered from head\\nto toe.....but it was not the case.\\xc2\\xa0 He\\nwas already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was\\nalready in place before the virus was released. \\n\\n\\nSome may ask....Bill Gates already predicted the outbreak in\\n\\n\\n2015...so the Chinese agenda cannot be true. The answer is. ..YES...Bill Gates\\ndid predict. But that prediction is based on a genuine virus outbreak.\\xc2\\xa0 Now China is also telling that the virus was\\npredicted well in advance. So that its agenda would play along well to match\\nthat prediction. China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision is to control the World economy by buying up\\nstocks now from countries facing the brink of severe ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.\\xc2\\xa0 Later China will announce that their Medical\\nResearchers have found a cure to destroy the virus.\\xc2\\xa0 Now China have other countries stocks in\\ntheir arsenal and these countries will soon be slave to their master...CHINA.\\n\\n\\nAgain Just Think about it... \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Doctor Who declared this virus is also believed to be silenced\\n\\n\\nby the Chinese Authorities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who can forget about SARS as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nNote:-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust trying to connect the threads and make sense, that is\\nall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis could be true or not.

First, you have Christian churches throughout the land selling miracles for money in support of a billionaire president while homeless people are being criminalized and dying without hope sleeping in their own feces. Virgins, (little children) go to school being taught to hate themselves coming out of the hearts of their classmates choosing suicide over life, what reason do these children have to go on caring in the world except to be a bully themselves someday? Avarice, a deadly sin is taking over the world in its money, in our history books you know in taking over the world bad things are going to happen. The only thing left that can save us is our instincts to survive. People are learning when it comes to common sense and the law, a closed mind is better than an open mind and this philosophy won the election. The intelligence of tomorrow (college students) are helping to spread a pandemic around the world while getting drunk and partying on spring break. Today's millennial generation is believing that Lucifer has the truest light of all while the Illuminati partner up in our nature to go after the brass ring. The only thing left is to kill the New Testament of the Bible which gives hope in the afterlife. Believing Jesus needs a gun to protect his property rights to copyright law pretty much kills any idea hope actually existed more than just a figment of the imagination. Only misery can save us now and with all the drugs going around I doubt that's going to work either. I know all this sounds extreme but you can research all of this in the libraries of our time. All you need is one crazy religion (Isis) that vows to kill pity for all time to come (sleeper cells) and all of this gets nailed to the wall.

That is just hospital need and does not even include the nursing homes, Skilled nursing facilities, out patient rehab, Home health agencies and nurse on call companies. PPE should be changed each time they enter and leave a room but they are putting their lives at risk by reusing the masks. They are asking for more because they are preparing for the apex/climax. You don\\'t ask for supplies during, you ask before so that you have what you need. \\n*You can stop reading here if you get it. If you still don\\'t understand, keep reading:\\nTrump said \" they are using more than they did before even when the hospitals are always full\". He says \"They are asking for 10k, 20k, to 300k.\" Then he said they must be going out of the back door. He is clueless as to how healthcare works. I know from personal experience. Under normal circumstances Healthcare workers don\\'t always need to use PPE, even if a hospital is full. It has nothing to do with being full, it has to do with if the pt has a communicable disease or if their is a question of it. So Typically, Gloves are used only a few times a shift ( if that ) unless you have a pt who has an infection or communicable disease ( ie. HIV with open wound or bleeding, HEP, other open wounds or risk of contacting body fluids). Nurses, doctors and therapists don\\'t wear gloves with all pts. You can go months without having to use a mask unless you have a pt with active TB, MRSA of nares, pnuemonia etc.\\xc2\\xa0 Gowns are typically used even less ( maybe once a month in a general hospital depending on setting or the floor you work on). Ventilators are used even less unless you have an emergency case, or are in a specialized hospital that focuses on respiratory conditions or trachs such as Kindred hospitals or long term acute cares. I can go 6 months to a year in my setting without needed to use a mask unless I have a cold that I don\\'t want my pt to catch or if the pt has pneumonia, flu, is on chemo etc. However, now that we have a \"Global Pandemic\" we are using masks all day with all pts, Gloves most of the time along with a lot of hand washing, etc.\\xc2\\xa0 So for him to stand there and ask why they need more now when they didn\\'t before. Ofcourse they do!! Technically under normal circumstances you are supposed to remove and discard your mask\\xc2\\xa0 as you exit the pts room and then get a new one upon entering the next pt room ( if you need it). You are not supposed to be wearing a mask between pts or all day. Also, CNAs ( certified nursing assistance also wear gloves to change pt briefs, all bathing and self care.
